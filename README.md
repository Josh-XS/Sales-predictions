# Sales Predictions
## How different variables affect sales

**Joshua Nickell**: 

### Business problem:

We need to find out which variables affect the sales the most

### Data:
The data can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR0TKEXKL-l0SVSGCehXIONnm0wttSHcPqgVceF7dUXcrrk1ClRQXGNCDFm0qWIfNrbCV6uuXWxh9P5/pub?gid=1274198617&single=true&output=csv


## Methods
I decided to drop Item_Identifier, Outlet_Identifier, and Outlet_Establishment_year, as they did not contribute to the sales predictions 

## Results

## Model

I decided to use the decision tree regressor because it was the most accurate model
The R2 was around 0.6 meaning that the model could predict 60% of variation in the target
The RMSE was around 1000, which was lower than the other model, but still not good
The model would perform OK, but there is some tuning that could be done, or another model that may perform better

## Recommendations:

I would recommend a random tree model for this data, as the current model is not as accurate as it could be
